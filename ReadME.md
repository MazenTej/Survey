# Survey and Test Console Application

## Overview
This is a **console-based Java application** that allows users to create, manage, and grade **surveys** and **tests** with various question types. The app supports different types of questions such as multiple-choice, true/false, and short answer. The main focus is to provide a user-friendly system for creating surveys and tests, recording user responses, and grading tests.

The application uses several design patterns (e.g., Singleton, Factory, Strategy) to manage survey creation and grading algorithms. It was developed using **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**, ensuring robust functionality and error handling.

## Features

- **Survey Creation**: Users can create surveys with multiple question types.
- **Test Creation**: Similar to surveys, but with the ability to define correct answers for automatic grading.
- **Multiple Question Types**:
  - Multiple-choice
  - True/False
  - Short answer
- **Grading System**: Automatically grade tests based on predefined answers.
- **Response Recording**: Save responses for both surveys and tests.
- **Design Patterns**: Utilizes the **Singleton**, **Factory**, and **Strategy** patterns for managing the core logic.
- **TDD**: Test-Driven Development was used to ensure reliability and accurate functionality.

## Tech Stack

- **Java**: The core programming language.
- **Design Patterns**: Singleton, Factory, and Strategy patterns for better organization and scalability.
- **JUnit**: For unit testing and ensuring functionality using TDD.
